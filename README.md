BFconnect is an innovative application that allows people who come to visit the institute to obtain information quickly and easily on school places.

### What does it do?
BFconnect allows each school to **innovate**, therefore to bring its information within everyone's reach. A solution that will allow people to better compare the various options that a school offers, so as to make the choice of the future of our children **smarter** and **safer**.
The technological novelty lies in the use of the **NFC tag**, an electronic device that transmits information to the phone simply by bringing it closer to it (4 cm max). These tags are stickers and will be scattered inside the school building at the entrance of the main laboratories.
Going around the school, families will be able to receive information about workshops and addresses **simply** by approaching their phone, also it is possible to download pdf files relating to each training course offered by IIS Belluzzi-FIoravanti.
For those who have a device that cannot read the NFC tag, it will still be possible to use the application through the use of the **QRcode**.
